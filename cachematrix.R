## makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Assign a value to x that is different from the current environment

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## solve() computes the inverse of a square matrix 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
